What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Honesty at first what most confused me was what exactly I needed to write and include in each part. I would plan more and understand what the assigment is asking of me. I keep trying to change things instead of sumbiting but I think it is better to resubmit and get feedback before you keep changing to get a clearer picture.
